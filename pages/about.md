faq:
  heading: FAQ
  items:
  - q: How long is the program?
    a: |-
      Rebel Squadrons are 16 weeks - 8 total coaching sessions of 90 minutes each.
  - q: Who are Squadrons for?
    a: |-
      New or seasoned sales reps who aren’t yet ready to go full Rebel Jedi, but need to build a full and healthy pipeline in the next 180 days.
  - q: How many people are in each group?
    a: |-
      There are 8 main rebels in our favorite saga, with 6 seeing the overthrow of the Empire. It’s only fitting that Squadrons be limited to 6-8 rebels.
  - q: How much does the program cost?
    a: |-
      $429/mo. for 4 mos.
  - q: Once I signup, then what happens?
    a: |-
      Each squadron has an official intro call and members are placed in a private group with their fellow 6-7 rebels. Rebellion market tools are shared so each member can start tailoring them for their prospects. This kickstarts the build of a prospecting and pipeline system you will use to create meetings-on-demand.
  - q: What kind of support will I get?
    a: |-
      Apart from group coaching calls, Rebels have access to a private Slack channel for their Squadron only, where you can post questions, submit pieces for feedback, share wins, etc. Your coach and other Rebel coaches/support personnel are in the channel daily to help.
